The challenge is to build out this multi-page e-commerce website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

It was completed using react & redux-toolkit and localstorage for persisting shopping cart data and react bootstrap for styling.

The final site contains following features / functions:

1.View the optimal layout for the app depending on device's screen size

2.See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

3.Add/Remove products from the cart

4.Edit product quantities in the cart

5.Fill in all fields in the checkout

6.Receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect during checkout

7.See correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart

8.Shipping always adds $50 to the order

9.VAT is calculated as 20% of the product total, excluding shipping

10.See an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary

11.Keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser
